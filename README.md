A complete guide to x86 architecture, assembly, memory management, paging, segmentation, SMM, BIOS....    

    This book tends to overview and teach x86 subjects in the eyes of a reverse engineer, malware analyst or a 
    hacker. We're not going to teach you how to build an OS or other subjects that are not related to those 
    mentioned above.
